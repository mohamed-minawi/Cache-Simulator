This Cache Simulator supports the following caches schemes:

1) Fully Associative
2) Direct Mapped
3) Set Associative

To fully suit the user, you can define the sizes of the block, ram, and cache. You can also choose the number of
iterations to simulate the cache.

There are 6 different memGens that return different addresses to simulate the memory differently.

The program prints the results in a file of the name of your choosing. 

The user calls the functions for the required cache scheme
